- Renamed URL fields in components so they are not Docker specific and can work for both Docker and Kubernetes. Examples: `HostGRPCUrl -> ExternalGRPCUrl`, `DockerWSRPCUrl -> InternalWSRPCUrl`
  - URLs prefixed with Internal, can be used as Docker internal URLs or Kubernetes internal URLs. In kubernetes the scope of internal can vary, can be either local URL available within the same namespace or cluster local URL, depending on the needs
  - URLs prefixed with External are for integrating components externally
