## FAQ

### Q: What should I do if I get "command not found: ghsecrets" after installation?

This error typically means that the directory where Go installs its binaries is not included in your system's PATH. The binaries are usually installed in $GOPATH/bin or $GOBIN. Here's how you can resolve this issue:

1. If you use `asdf` run `asdf reshim golang`

2. Or, add Go bin directory to PATH:

- First, find out where your Go bin directory is by running:

  ```sh
  echo $(go env GOPATH)/bin
  ```

  This command will print the path where Go binaries are installed, typically something like /home/username/go/bin

- Add the following line at the end of your shell config file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`), usually located at `~/`:

  ```sh
  export PATH="$PATH:<path-to-go-bin>"
  ```

- Apply the changes by sourcing the file:
  ```sh
  source ~/.bashrc  # Use the appropriate file like .zshrc if needed
  ```

3. Alternatively, run using the full path:

   If you prefer not to alter your PATH, or if you are troubleshooting temporarily, you can run the tool directly using its full path:

   ```sh
   $(go env GOPATH)/bin/ghsecrets set
   ```
