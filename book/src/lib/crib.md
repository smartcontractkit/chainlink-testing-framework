### CRIB Connector

<div class="warning">

`GAPv1` won't be supported in the future, you can still use [this example](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/tree/develop/integration-tests/crib), [CI run](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/actions/workflows/crib-integration-test.yml) but expect this to be changed.
