# Mocking Services

The framework aims to equip you with all the necessary tools to write end-to-end system-level tests, while still allowing the flexibility to mock third-party services that are not critical to your testing scope.

## Configuration
```toml
[fake]
  # port to start Gin server
  port = 9111
```
