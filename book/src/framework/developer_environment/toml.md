# Configuration

We generate config specification for all our components automatically.

Here is full specification for what can be specificed in `env.toml` for devenv.

`.out` fields are useful in case you want to use remote component, or integrate in other language than `Go`, otherwise can be ignored.

```toml
{{#include ../../toml.toml}}
```
