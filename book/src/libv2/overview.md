# Lib (maintained)

Since the advent of the CTFv2 (aka [Framework](../framework/overview.md)) most of the small libraries that formed tha part of the previous framework has been
deprecated and are neither actively maintained nor well documented. Those which did make it to `v2`, but are not fully integrated into the framework, are described
in this section.

Following components made it that far:
* [concurrency](./concurrency.md) - equal division of tasks between N parallel workers
* [client](./client.md) - standalone clients for variety of applications: Anvil, Loki, Prometheus, Postgres and others.
* [logging](./logging.md) - thread-aware logging
