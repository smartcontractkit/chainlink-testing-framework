# BenchSpy - Getting started

All of the following examples assume that you have access to following applications:
* Grafana
* Loki
* Prometheus

> [!NOTE]
> The easiest way to run them locally is by using CTFv2's [observability stack](../../../framework/observability/observability_stack.md).
> Just remember to first install the `CTF CLI` as described in [CTFv2 Getting Started](../../../framework/getting_started.md) chapter.

Since BenchSpy is tightly couplesd with WASP it's highly recommended that you [get familiar with it first](../overview.md), if you haven't yet.
