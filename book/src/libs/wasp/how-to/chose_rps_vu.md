# WASP - How to Choose Between RPS and VUs

When writing a test, you need to decide whether to use **RPS** or **VUs** as your load type.

> [!WARNING]  
> RPS load type can only be used with a `Gun`, and VUs can only be used with a `VirtualUser`.

## RPS (Requests Per Second)

You should use **RPS** when your goal is to measure **throughput**. This load type implements an **open model**, where:
* The number of requests is fixed.
* The load is adjusted to meet the target RPS.
* The system's response time has no impact on the rate of load generation.

In an RPS-based test, new requests are sent continuously, regardless of how long previous requests take.

        Profile(Test) ->> Generator(Gun): Start with (API, TestData)
        loop Schedule
            Scheduler ->> Scheduler: Process schedule segment
            Scheduler ->> Generator(Gun): Set new RPS target
            loop RPS load
                Generator(Gun) ->> Generator(Gun): Execute Call() in parallel
                Generator(Gun) ->> Promtail: Save CallResult
            end
            Promtail ->> Loki: Send batch<br/>when ready or timeout
        end
        Scheduler ->> Scheduler: All segments done<br/>wait all responses<br/>test ends
        Profile(Test) ->> Grafana: Check alert groups<br/>FAIL or PASS the test
    end
```

## VirtualUser (VUs)

Use **VUs** when working with **stateful protocols** or workflows. With `VirtualUser`, the **requests per second** rate cannot be guaranteed because:
* Each iteration begins only after the previous one finishes.
* The load follows a **closed model**, where the system's response time affects the RPS.

If the system takes longer to respond, iterations take longer, and the RPS decreases.

### Example VUs Test Diagram

    participant Profile(Test)
    participant Scheduler
    participant Generator(VUs)
    participant VU1
    participant VU2
    participant Promtail
    participant Loki
    participant Grafana
    loop Test Execution
        Profile(Test) ->> Generator(VUs): Start with (API, TestData)
        loop Schedule
            Scheduler ->> Scheduler: Process schedule segment
            Scheduler ->> Generator(VUs): Set new VUs target
            loop VUs load
                Generator(VUs) ->> Generator(VUs): Add/remove VUs
                Generator(VUs) ->> VU1: Start/end
                Generator(VUs) ->> VU2: Start/end
                VU1 ->> VU1: Run loop, execute multiple calls
                VU1 ->> Promtail: Save []CallResult
                VU2 ->> VU2: Run loop, execute multiple calls
                VU2 ->> Promtail: Save []CallResult
                Promtail ->> Loki: Send batch<br/>when ready or timeout
            end
        end
        Scheduler ->> Scheduler: All segments done<br/>wait all responses<br/>test ends
        Profile(Test) ->> Grafana: Check alert groups<br/>FAIL or PASS the test
    end
```

In this model, `VU2` starts only after `VU1` has finished its iteration.

## Summary

* Use **RPS** for:
    - Stateless protocols.
    - Measuring throughput.
    - Scenarios where the load generation rate must remain constant.

* Use **VUs** for:
    - Stateful protocols.
    - Workflows that involve multiple steps.
    - Scenarios where response time impacts the load generation rate.
