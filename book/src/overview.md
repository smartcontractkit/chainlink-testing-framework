# Intro

The Chainlink Testing Framework is a toolset designed for end-to-end testing of Chainlink products, focusing on functionality, resiliency, and performance.

This documentation is intended for:
- Chainlink engineers writing end-to-end tests in [Golang](https://go.dev/)
- Engineers using other languages who want to integrate with the Chainlink platform

To get started with writing system-level tests, refer to the [Framework](./framework/getting_started.md) chapter, where we guide you from basic to more complex scenarios.

See mono repository [tooling](monorepo-tools.md) to start working with Go modules.

[Repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-testing-framework) contains two major pieces:
- [Framework](framework/overview.md)
- [Libraries](libraries.md)
