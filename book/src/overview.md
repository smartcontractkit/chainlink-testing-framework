# Intro



The Chainlink Testing Framework is a toolset designed for end-to-end testing of Chainlink products, focusing on functionality, resiliency, and performance.

This documentation is intended for:
- Chainlink engineers writing end-to-end tests in [Golang](https://go.dev/)
- Engineers using other languages who want to integrate with the Chainlink platform

To get started with writing tests, refer to the [Framework](./framework/getting_started.md) chapter, where we guide you from basic to more complex scenarios.

If you want to build integration with Chainlink not in [Golang](https://go.dev/), please refer to our [Interactive](framework/interactive.md) chapter.

[Repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-testing-framework) contains two major pieces:
- [Framework](framework/overview.md)
- [Libraries](libraries.md)
