# Intro

The Chainlink Testing Framework (CTF) is a blockchain development framework written in Go. 

Its primary purpose is to help Chainlink developers create extensive integration, e2e, performance, and chaos tests to ensure the stability of the chainlink project.

It can also be helpful to those who just want to use chainlink oracles in their projects to help test their contracts, or even for those that aren't using chainlink.

This documentation is primarily for:
- Developers looking to write end-to-end tests
- Quality Assurance Engineers aiming to test locally

To get started with writing tests, refer to the [Framework](./framework/getting_started.md) chapter, where we guide you from basic to more complex scenarios.

[Repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-testing-framework) contains two major pieces:
- [Framework](framework/overview.md)
- [Libraries](libraries.md)

If you're a non-technical user or want to build integration with Chainlink not in `Golang`, please refer to our [Interactive](framework/interactive.md) chapter.
