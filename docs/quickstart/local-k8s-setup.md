In order to run tests, we need a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) (often abbreviated as *K8s*) cluster, and a way to connect to it (see [why Kubernetes](https://smartcontractkit.github.io/integrations-framework/setup/kubernetes.html#why)). In order to connect to a K8s cluster, we need to [download kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/releases/download/). 

<div class="note note-yellow">
The Kubernetes setup and the resources needed to run a K8s cluster for these tests is a common pain point. We're exploring ways to lessen the resources needed, and possibly expand to other systems as well as Kubernetes.
