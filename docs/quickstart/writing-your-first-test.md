# Writing Your First Test

Tests are written entirely in [Go](https://go.dev/). If you're familiar with Go and want your own setup, feel free to do so and use the code below as examples. Otherwise, you can utilize our [template repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-integration-tests-template) which contains tons of examples in a ready-to-go codebase.
