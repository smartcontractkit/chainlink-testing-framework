# Running our Tests

We have some tests written that we keep up to date in the [main Chainlink repo](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink). In order to run them for yourself, follow the steps below.

1. [Install Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#installing-ginkgo): go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2/ginkgo
2. Clone the latest develop branch of the [Chainlink repo](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink)
3. See the tests and running instructions in the [integration-tests folder](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/tree/develop/integration-tests)
