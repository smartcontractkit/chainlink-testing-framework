## Ginkgo and Gomega

We've been using [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo), a BDD testing framework for Go that we've found handy
for organizing and running tests. You should be able to use any other testing framework you like, including Go's built-in
`testing` package, but the examples you find here will be in Ginkgo and its accompanying assertions library,
[Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/). Both of which are easily human readable however (part of why we like it) and
shouldn't hurt your understanding of the framework at all.
