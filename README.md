# Chainlink Integration Framework
A framework for interacting with chainlink nodes, environments, and other blockchain systems. The framework is primarilly intended to facillitate testing chainlink features and stability.

### How to Test
`go test ./...`

### // TODO
* Add more chainlink node checks
* Enable connecting chainlink node interfaces to actual running nodes in an environment
* Enable interaction with outside blockchains
