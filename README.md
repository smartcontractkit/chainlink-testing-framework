![Lint](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/integrations-framework/actions/workflows/lint.yaml/badge.svg)

A framework for interacting with chainlink nodes, environments, and other blockchain systems.
The framework is primarilly intended to facillitate testing chainlink features and stability.

## WIP

This framework is still very much a work in progress, and will have frequent changes, many of which will probably be
breaking.

### Setup

Install CLI

```sh
make install_cli
```

## Usage

A simple example on deploying and interaction with a simple contract using this framework and [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo)

```go
var _ = Describe("Basic Contract Interactions", func() {
  var (
    suiteSetup    actions.SuiteSetup
    networkInfo   actions.NetworkInfo
    defaultWallet client.BlockchainWallet
  )

  BeforeEach(func() {
    By("Deploying the environment", func() {
      var err error
      suiteSetup, err = actions.SingleNetworkSetup(
        environment.NewChainlinkCluster(0),
        client.DefaultNetworkFromConfig,
        tools.ProjectRoot,
      )
      Expect(err).ShouldNot(HaveOccurred())
      networkInfo = suiteSetup.DefaultNetwork()
      defaultWallet = networkInfo.Wallets.Default()
    })
  })

  It("exercises basic contract usage", func() {
    By("deploying the storage contract", func() {
      // Deploy storage
      storeInstance, err := suiteSetup.Deployer.DeployStorageContract(defaultWallet)
      Expect(err).ShouldNot(HaveOccurred())

      testVal := big.NewInt(5)

      // Interact with contract
      err = storeInstance.Set(testVal)
      Expect(err).ShouldNot(HaveOccurred())
      val, err := storeInstance.Get(context.Background())
      Expect(err).ShouldNot(HaveOccurred())
      Expect(val).To(Equal(testVal))
     })
  })

  AfterEach(func() {
    By("Tearing down the environment", suiteSetup.TearDown())
  })
})
```

## Execution Environment

Ephemeral environments are automatically deployed with Kubernetes. To run tests, you either need a deployed cluster
in an environment, or a local installation.

### Locally

When running tests locally, it's advised to use minikube. To spin up a cluster, use:

```sh
minikube start
```

### Remotely

To run against a remote Kubernetes cluster, ensure your current context is the cluster you want to run against as the
framework always uses current context.

## Test Execution

This framework advises the use of [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo) for test execution, but tests still can be
ran with the go CLI.

### Ginkgo

Run:

```sh
ginkgo -r
```

### Go

Run:

```sh
go test ./..
```

### Volume tests

```sh
NETWORK="ethereum_geth_performance" make test_performance
```

### Build contracts

Example of generating go bindings for Ethereum contracts

```sh
ifcli build_contracts -c config.yml
```

### Create environment

Example of creating environment with one Chainlink node and Geth dev network

```sh
ifcli create_env -n ethereum_geth -t chainlink -c 1
```
