# BenchSpy - Getting Started

The following examples assume you have access to the following applications:
- Grafana
- Loki
- Prometheus

> [!NOTE]
> The easiest way to run these locally is by using CTFv2's [observability stack](../../../framework/observability/observability_stack.md).
> Be sure to install the `CTF CLI` first, as described in the [CTFv2 Getting Started](../../../framework/getting_started.md) guide.

Since BenchSpy is tightly coupled with WASP, we highly recommend that you [get familiar with it first](../overview.md) if you haven't already.

Ready? [Let's get started!](./first_test.md)

> [!NOTE]
> You can `BENCHSPY_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to control the log level.
