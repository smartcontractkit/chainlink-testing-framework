## Havoc

The `havoc` package is a Go library designed to facilitate chaos testing within Kubernetes environments using Chaos Mesh. It offers a structured way to define, execute, and manage chaos experiments as code, directly integrated into Go applications or testing suites. This package simplifies the creation and control of Chaos Mesh experiments, including network chaos, pod failures, and stress testing on Kubernetes clusters.
